## Requirements

1. **Identify Coding Platforms:**
   - Specify the coding platforms you want to integrate with (e.g., LeetCode, Codeforces, HackerRank).
   
2. **Information to Track:**
   - Determine the information to track for each problem (e.g., problem title, description, status, priority, user email).

## Database Setup

3. **Create a Database:**
   - Set up a database to store problem data and user information.
   - You can use a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL.

## User Registration and Authentication

4. **User Registration and Authentication:**
   - Implement user registration and authentication.
   - Link user email addresses to their accounts on coding platforms.
   - OAuth can be used for authentication.

## API Integration

5. **API Integration:**
   - Integrate with coding platforms' APIs to fetch problem data.
   - Each platform may have its API; authenticate and request data using API calls.

## Problem Tracking System

6. **Problem Tracking System:**
   - Create a web application using chosen technologies (JavaScript, React, etc.).
   - Users can report issues stored in the database with fields like problem title, description, platform, and user email.

## Email Notifications

7. **Email Notifications:**
   - Implement email notifications to alert users of updates to their reported problems.
   - Libraries like Nodemailer (for Node.js) can be used for sending emails.

## Problem Status and Priority

8. **Problem Status and Priority:**
   - Allow users to set the status (e.g., open, in progress, resolved) and priority (e.g., high, medium, low) for reported problems.

## Admin Panel

9. **Admin Panel:**
   - Create an admin panel to manage and prioritize reported problems.
   - Admins can assign problems to developers, change their status, and set priorities.

## User Dashboard

10. **User Dashboard:**
    - Implement a user dashboard where users can see the status of their reported problems and any updates.

## Testing and Deployment

11. **Testing and Deployment:**
    - Test the application thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
    - Deploy the application to a web server or a cloud platform like AWS, Heroku, or Azure.

## Security Measures

12. **Security Measures:**
    - Implement security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.

## Documentation

13. **Documentation:**
    - Create documentation for your application, including how to use it and how to integrate with different coding platforms.

## User Support

14. **User Support:**
    - Provide user support for any issues or questions users may have while using your problem tracker.

## Continuous Improvement

15. **Continuous Improvement:**
    - Collect feedback from users and make improvements to your problem tracker based on their suggestions and needs.
